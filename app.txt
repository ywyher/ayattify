# What is ayattify
its an app i have been wanting to build for the past 3 years each time i started it the development stopped due to me not having the required experience, but now i surely i can

this is how the app works:
fetch all Quran chapters into a select list the user then select one
afterwards all verses are fetched into one select list called verses-from the user then select which verse would he like to begin with
afterwards all data **(excluding the selected verse and the verses behind it)** are fetched into another select called verses-to the user then select which verse he would like to end with

after the chapter/verses-from/verses-to are all set the verses between verses-from and verses-to gets fetched into the main component so the user can interact with the app by:
- editing the style of each verse (hopefully words too)
- editing the main component (the background for the verses)
- choosing between multiple themes
- custom backgrounds
- images
and a lot more

each component we have here from the verses to the background component for the canvas is a Draggable/Resizable/Rotatable

# Libraries

- [Draggable/Resizable components with react-rnd](https://github.com/bokuweb/react-rnd)
- Rotatation functionality is implemented by us using React
- [Selecto](https://github.com/daybrush/selecto) for selecting multiple components and interacting with the at once **(not implemented yet)**

> [!note]
> for draggable/resizable component you can combine these two:
> - [dnd-kit](https://github.com/clauderic/dnd-kit)
> - [re-resizable](https://github.com/bokuweb/re-resizable)
>   
> its a solid solution **(only if you need more advanced functionalities from dnd-kit)** but due to me being inexperienced couldn't get it to work with good performance while having multiple draggable components at once (which is a key feature in our app)

> [!note]
> [Moveable](https://github.com/daybrush/moveable) is a pretty solid library too and it have a lot of required features for our app (even ones i didn't even implement yet due to how tricky they are) 
> The reason i didn't use it tho is because it's haven't had a single commit in 2 years (basically not maintained)
> Also not sure whether it works with react-19 or as well
>
btw iam aware that iam using [Selecto](https://github.com/daybrush/selecto) which is from the same dev and haven't been maintained as well but due to its functionality being not as crucial to me as the other ones i didn't mind using it **(also didn't find any alternatives till now)**

# Quranic 
## Fonts
there are multiple types of Quranic font most notably:
- [Uthmani hafs](https://qul.tarteel.ai/mushaf_layouts/5)
- [Indopak](https://qul.tarteel.ai/mushaf_layouts/6)
- QPC (**main**)

QPC is a font used on a glyph code which is character that resemble a specific word or character after applying the font, we have 3 versions of it:
- [v1](https://qul.tarteel.ai/mushaf_layouts/2) -> handwritten (**secondary**)
- [v2](https://qul.tarteel.ai/mushaf_layouts/1) -> **main one**
- [v4 tajweed]https://qul.tarteel.ai/mushaf_layouts/19

these are all you need to know about fonts to create this application

### Where to install fonts from ?
- [main page](https://qul.tarteel.ai/resources/font)
	- [QPC V1](https://qul.tarteel.ai/resources/font/238)
	- [QPC v2](https://qul.tarteel.ai/resources/font/249)
	- [Surah names](https://qul.tarteel.ai/resources/font/237) (still don't know how to use it) -> looks good

- [Surah names quran.com](https://quran.com/fonts/quran/surah-names/v1/sura_names.woff2) (using this one for now) -> looks bad

## Scripts
you can either choose between using an API or local JSON/sqlite
- [quran.com API](https://api-docs.quran.com/docs/category/quran.com-api)
- [JSON/sqlite](https://qul.tarteel.ai/resources/quran-script)

the scripts i used are (**main**)
- [QPC V2 Glyphs - Ayah by Ayah](https://qul.tarteel.ai/resources/quran-script/80)
- [QPC V1 Glyphs - Ayah by Ayah](https://qul.tarteel.ai/resources/quran-script/81)

more useful ones:
- [QPC V2 Glyph - Word by Word](https://qul.tarteel.ai/resources/quran-script/61)
- [QPC V1 Glyphs - Word by Word](https://qul.tarteel.ai/resources/quran-script/57)

> [!note]
> the difference between Word by Word and Ayah by Ayah:
>
> Ayah by Ayah contains the records of each ayah in the Quran on its own containing all of its words and symbols allowing for:
> - pros
> 	- smaller file (~1mb)
> 	- WAY less records: 6000
> 	- faster on the client side
> 	- faster to query data
> - cons: 
> 	- less customization (can't edit styling for word by word) -> not sure yet to figure if its possible or no
> 
> Word by Word contains the records of each wsymbol in the Quran on its own:
> - pros
> 	- can customize eacord/h word styling on its own (not sure if its possible with ayah by ayah or)
> - cons
> 	- huge amounts of records: 80000
> 	- big file size (~5mb)
> 	- slower on the client side
> 	- slower to query data
>
> td;lr:
> just use ayah by ayah format, the trade offs for word by word aren't worth it
